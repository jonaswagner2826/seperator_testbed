# Ruths Lab Air Separator
> Air Separator test bed used for reaserch in cyber-physical security of industrial control systems.

In our research we have devised mathematical tools to help quantify the impact an attacker can have on a control system.  We use this process control system to demonstrate attacks, and also demonstrate the effectiveness of our tools to detect and mitigate such attacks.
